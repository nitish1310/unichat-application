## Introduction
In this project, I built a full-fledged Firebase Chat Application. With social authentication including Google and Facebook using Firebase, online statuses, great design, and functionality, image support, sound notifications, the ability to create multiple rooms, and much more. 
Technoloy used: Routing, Firebase Social Login, Firebase Google Login, Firebase Facebook Login, React Context API, Chat Engine, REST API's, environment variables.

## Usage

To run the application locally; clone the repo, install dependencies and run the app.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nitish1310/unichat-application
$ cd unichat-application
$ npm start
```

The app starts in development mode and opens a browser window on `http://localhost:3000`. The project rebuilds and the browser reloads automatically when source files are changed. Any build or runtime errors are propagated and displayed in the browser.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server

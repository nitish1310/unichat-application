## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial. In this video, we will create a full Realtime Chat Application

## Usage

To run the application locally; clone the repo, install dependencies and run the app.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nitish1310/unichat-application
$ cd unichat-application
$ npm start
```

The app starts in development mode and opens a browser window on `http://localhost:3000`. The project rebuilds and the browser reloads automatically when source files are changed. Any build or runtime errors are propagated and displayed in the browser.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
